# EduroamCAT- Android App
A tool to allow users to configure their device for eduroam wireless networks. This tool requires a configuration file from your home institution in order acquire the configuration settings needed. These can also be discovered by the tool, if the institution has CAT configured.
Due to limitations in the Android OS, the application needs to set up a screen lock if none is already set. 
The configuration file is in a standardised file format and can be obtained from eduroam Configuration Assistant Tool deployments (such as https://cat.eduroam.org and others). 
The tool also provides some status information on the eduroam connection.
